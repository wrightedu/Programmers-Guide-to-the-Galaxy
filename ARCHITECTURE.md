# Architecture

This document describes the high level architecture of the project.  Things to make sure you note:

* [Bird's Eye View](ARCHITECTURE.md#birds-eye-view)
* [Code Map](ARCHITECTURE.md#code-map)

## Bird's Eye View

But I'm not a bird...

Delete this section by highlighting this line and in vim: `d9d`

At the highest level, this project aims to inform a user on working with the team.  Top level 
files like this one are likely to be required in other projects so can be copied directly from here.

Since this project has no input or output, this architecture document is mostly a matter of example.  This will need to 
be heavily edited from project to project so treat this more as an outline (hence the delete this 
in vim command).

## Code Map

This section talks briefly about various important directories and data structures. 
Pay attention to the Architecture Invariant sections. They often talk about things 
which are deliberately absent in the source code.

### `Getting-Started/`
Basic guides to pre-requisite knowledge that will likely be needed by all.  Start here.

### `Advanced-Topics/`
Guides to more advanced topics that might only apply to a specific project (or future project).
