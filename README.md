# DON'T PANIC

So you've stumbled into the unenviable position of having to figure out what to do.  
Don't worry, there's a repository for that! Ideally this repository will answer 
all of your questions on Life, the universe, and everything; but in reality it 
will only be able to help you get along working with a constantly revolving cast of
student developers that have found themselves doing much too much work for almost,
but not entirely *unlike* enough money.

### "But how do I use this guide to make my life easier?"
Good question!
This repository will provide example files, walkthroughs, and simple instructions on
many of the key areas you might need to get up to speed on before tackling projects
and classword in the Computer Science Department. 

Just check out the (hopefully) usefully named `*.md` files in this top 
level directory. (Note: in the above name, the asterisk character `*` is a *wildcard*
and implies that you should be interested in all files that end with the characters 
`.md`). Any files that are in all capitalized letters, and the `.gitignore`  may be 
useful to copy to other repositories that you create, although changes may be 
necessary. 

## Architecture

To find out more about the files and folders, which will also get you up to speed on
how to use this repository, check out the `ARCHITECTURE.md`. 

## Contributing

After you are familiar with the architecture of the project (in this project that means
being comfortable with all of the skills in `Getting-Started/`, you need to be sure you
know the rules about contributing to the project. For this there is the `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Issues and Projects

Most of the workflow on a project is done through issues and projects.  The [issues](https://github.com/cse-devteam/Programmers-Guide-to-the-Galaxy/issues)
tab by default shows all open issues with the project. And issue is a task, bug, feature 
enhancement, or other thread of communication on a specific tracked topic. Through issues
and their associated comments we can communicate on what we are currently tackling.

Just a quick note on issues, not all issues in this repo refer to developments in this repo. 
We use this repo as a sort of dumping ground for all issues that aren't bound to a specific 
project, since CSE Support does much more than just development.

[Projects](https://github.com/cse-devteam/Programmers-Guide-to-the-Galaxy/projects) are github
organizational tools that help you order and priortize work. Most issues are immediately pushed
into the default project board in a repository for assignment to a developer.
